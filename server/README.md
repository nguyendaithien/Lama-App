# Boilerplate for NodeJs with Express, Typeorm, Mysql (using Typescript)

This is a base source code for continue developing other project.

This code still have some comments for explaination, remove them if not necessary.

The entities current has: User. All of theme have only some sample fields and relations so I could write a fews API for Signin and Signup (containning some middlewares).

## Main tech

- `Node.js` with `npm`, `yarn` for dependencies management.
- `Express` framework for building a RESTful API server
- `Typeorm` for work easier with database
- `Mysql`
- `Typescript` language (support build to js files with absolute path)
- `Winston` for logger (already installed with Vietnamese timezone)
- `OpenAPI` for API documentation.

## Development

### Clone repository

```
git clone git@github.com:gerpann/gerpan-express-typeorm-boilerplate.git
```

### Prepare

I used `node` version `14.17.0` (The `lts` version at the time I write this), but you can also install other `lts` version

```
nvm install 14.9.0
```

or

```
nvm install lts
```

I _recommend_ you to install `yarn` at global scope before install dependencies of this source code

```
npm install -g yarn
```

The first time, you will need to run this script to install dependencies.

```
yarn
```

For run with database (I used Mysql), you can config it in `.env` file and some files in folder `src/config`.

Normally, you have to create a schema before run any code relate with database.

**Script to build source code to JS:**

```
yarn build
```

**Then just start the server wit**

```
yarn start
```

_To see some other scripts you can open file `package.json` for detail._

## Generate tables for new (empty) schema

- Make sure your schema has just been created or does not have any tables.
- Next, open file `package.json` and find in the script `migration:generate` where `-n Gerpan` and replace them with your favourite name (don't think too much because this just for make migrations data)
- Then run script following script to generate script for create table in the future

```
yarn migration:generate
```

- After the previous step, you will see a file have name like `1625156147394-XXX.ts` (timestamp-yourname.ts), it contains data to make tables for schema.
- Finally, run the below script to apply this to your schema.

```
yarn migration:run
```
